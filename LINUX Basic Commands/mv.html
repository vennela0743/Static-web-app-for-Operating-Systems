        <h3>
            mv stands for move. mv is used to move one or more files or directories from one place to another in a file system like UNIX. 
            It has two distinct functions: <br>
            (i) It renames a file or folder. <br>
            (ii) It moves a group of files to a different directory. <br>
            No additional space is consumed on a disk during renaming. This command normally works silently means no prompt for confirmation.
             <br>  
                Syntax:<br>  
                mv [Option] source destination
