        <h2>
            On Unix-like operating systems, the rm command removes (deletes) files.
            rm removes each file specified on the command line. By default, it does not remove directories.
            When rm is executed with the -r or -R options, it recursively deletes any matching directories, their subdirectories, 
            and all files they contain. See removing directories below for details.
            The removal process unlinks a file name in a filesystem from its associated data, 
            and marks that space on the storage device as usable by future writes. In other words, when you remove a file,
             the data in the file isn't changed, but it's no longer associated with a file name.
            The data itself is not destroyed, but after being unlinked with rm, 
            it becomes inaccessible. Remove your files wisely! 
            It's not like putting something in the Windows Recycle Bin; 
            once you rm a file or directory, there is no way to undo it.
